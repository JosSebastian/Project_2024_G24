# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 24

## 1. Group members:
1. Jos Sebastian 
2. Jackson Stone
3. Chase Fletcher
4. Ryan Swetonic

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)
The topic of this project is the implementation, evaluation, and analysis of various parallel sorting algorithms and how they will behave in various situations with differing problems sizes, number of available processors, and levels of sorting completion.

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort:
- Sample Sort:
- Merge Sort:
- Radix Sort:

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
